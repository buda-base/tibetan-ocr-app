# Tibetan OCR local app

This app is a free and open source offline App that can be installed on a local compter to run Tibetan OCR on batches of images (including in PDFs). It was developed by Eric Werner for the [Buddhist Digital Resource Center](https://www.bdrc.io).

### Main features

The app can open one or multiple files and run OCR on them. It can export plain text or [PageXML](https://github.com/PRImA-Research-Lab/PAGE-XML) (a format it shares with [Transkribus](https://www.transkribus.org/)). 

It can also optionally dewarp images as well as convert the output to Wylie.

Instead of providing one model that can handle all styles of Tibetan writing, we provide a few different models that we encourage users to experiment with to see what fits their data best.
